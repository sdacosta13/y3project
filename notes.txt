week 1:
 Rewrote LCD handling script and started work on the SVC handler
 LCD now has support for colouring the characters and background separately
 Ive split the OS into more file then in COMP22712 for better organisation
 printc has been fixed, it now can print chars without printstr
 the behaviour of the control characters needs to be tested (specifically the edge cases)

Week 4:
  Having been working on adding a script for KMD to enable a keyboard similar to the keypad in COMP22712
  I have been using the microcontrollers environment for KMD and modifying it.
  The modifications involve writing a C shared object which I can reference in jimulator.conf of the KMD build
  This C script forks a new proccess which starts a python script which runs the glade user interface
  The python script then writes the button pushes and releases to a shared memory which the C will in theory
  Use to generate interrupts and pass the data to an address in komodo
  There are 62 keys on the keyboard and I intend to make it able to pass uppercase characters to KMD

  Currently the keyboard can cause an interrupt but doesnt write any data to KMD

  The keyboard now writes ascii codes to F1003000 replacing the microcontrollers keypad location
  Limitations:
    It only writes the first keypress that it encounters, this should not be a problem as I only have 1 cursor
    so multiple key presses being detected are unnecessary
