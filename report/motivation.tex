The motivation for this project stems from previous courses I have taken such as COMP15111, Fundamentals of Computer Architecture and COMP22712, Micro-controllers. When taking these course I really enjoyed the challenges behind working within an ARM based environment, such as working with few 'variables' and having no pre-made software made for you. For me, these challenges raised the question of how viable it is to write an operating system for a micro-controller. While I had done a simple form of this for COMP22712, I wanted to take it further by implementing more complex features. In addition to this I wanted to improve upon the work I had done in COMP22712. This work hand been relatively rushed and messy as I was having to learn on the go, and I did not have much time to re-factor. From this I derived two main goals for this project. I wanted to develop and OS which was easier to read through and keep organised, and I wanted to develop some sort of process management service for the ARM chip.
