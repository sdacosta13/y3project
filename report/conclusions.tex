As a learning exercise, this project was quite successful and enjoyable to complete. Not only did I develop a basic operating system, I learnt about some of the challenges faced by low level software developers. In addition, I feel that this project has reinforced good lessons regarding commenting, code consistency, and organisation. I have a new appreciation for documentation and the information that it provides. In the following chapter I will discuss where I could improve and where I felt I did well. 
\subsection{Project Goals}
\subsubsection{Objective 1}
The goal to support the basic functions of an Operating System was achieved adequately. My system provides access to abstract functions used to interact with input and output devices. It can also initialise the system to a safe valid state. This accomplishes the main points in Objective 1, but goes no further. With more work I could add more functions such as access to drawing functions for the virtual screen, or I could develop dynamic data structures usable by the user.
\subsubsection{Objective 2}
The goal to develop a virtual keyboard went well, but I feel a more robust implementation would definitely possible with more time. Modifying the virtual environment was a significant technical challenge which required me to tinker with various technologies that I had not used before. Developing the plug-in for Jimulator was quite an achievement considering that I could not find much documentation on how to perform this task. 
\subsubsection{Objective 3}
The third goal was to develop the thread management system. I was very proud of accomplishing this goal. My implementation does include some glaring flaws, but overcoming this technical challenge was very fulfilling. Threading is task which I have found I can struggle with when developing higher level code, so being able to implement threading at a lower level feels reassuring. My final system does need a rework, to account for the shortfalls regarding multiple instances of the same object code, however I am pleased with the overall result.
